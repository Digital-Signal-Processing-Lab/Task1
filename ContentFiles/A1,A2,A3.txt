Waveform of my voice signal A1 
The utterance of digit '7' is recorded using inbuilt recorder app in mobilephone. The properties like Numchannels, SampleRate, BitsPerSample, BitRate are same which are 2, 44100, 16, -1 respectively. But TotalSamples were 142080 and Duration is 3.2218s. As the default format record was set to .wav format there was no need for conversion. A segment of the voice signal from 2.64s to 2.65s is plotted in Fig. 2.3.
Waveform of my voice signal A2 
The utterance of digit '9' is recorded using inbuilt recorder app in mobilephone. The properties like Numchannels, SampleRate, BitsPerSample, BitRate are same which are 2, 44100, 16, -1 respectively. But TotalSamples were 149184 and Duration is 3.3829s. As the default format record was set to .wav format, there was no need for conversion. A segment of the voice signal from 2.08s to 2.085s is plotted in Fig. 2.4.
Waveform of my voice signal A3 
The utterance of digit '11' is recorded using inbuilt recorder app in mobilephone.
